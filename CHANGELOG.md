# Changelog

What each version of SFE added or fixed. What an upgrade changes for an existing install (database, settings, first
scan) is in [docs/upgrading.md](docs/upgrading.md).

## 1.36.0

### Added

- Search by kind of file: `type:image`, `type:video`, `type:audio`, `type:other`, by the extension lists of
  Administration › Scanning › File types; several are either-or, and `-type:` excludes.
- Search results sort by **Duration** and **Resolution** (width × height). Files whose value is known come first, the
  others follow by path.
- The search box's syntax help lists `type:` and `d:`.

## 1.35.0

### Added

- Picture editor: the viewer's **Edit** button (or E) crops a picture, freely or to an aspect ratio, and saves the
  result as a new file, never changing the original.
- Rights `files.edit` and `settings.editor`, and a Picture editor settings page (output folder, quality).
- New rights now reach the built-in groups of existing spaces once, on the first start after an upgrade.

## 1.34.1

### Fixed

- A space's own administrator could add accounts from other spaces (or from none) to the space's groups. Only server
  administrators can do that now.

## 1.34.0

### Added

- Accounts, groups and rights, with a setup page that creates the first administrator, and a sign-in page.
- Guest access for visitors without an account.
- Several libraries (spaces) on one server, each with its own root, index and caches.
- Settings by level: server, library and personal preferences (My account), with locks.
- Links given to an external media player now expire.

## 1.33.0

### Added

- Durations of videos and audio files, read by scans: shown on tiles, rows and in the viewer, and searchable with `d:`
  (`d:>10m`, `d:1:30`).
